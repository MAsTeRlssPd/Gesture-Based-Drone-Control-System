# Gesture-Based-Drone-Control-System
A real-time hand gesture recognition system that enables touchless drone control using a webcam, MediaPipe hand landmarks, and a machine learning classifier. The system detects hand gestures and maps them to drone-like commands such as takeoff, land, move directions, hover, flip, and capture photos.
